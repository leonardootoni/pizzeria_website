            <p> We started as a small local family business and store, beginning with just a stone oven and regular dough and cheese.
            However, we started to cater for small events, such as birthday parties, meetings, and even weddings.

            Today we have many locations across the GTA and are a vastly known restaurant. We strive too meet our customers needs and wants daily,
            as without you guys, we would have not been able to make it this far. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!</p>

            and religious celebrations. Feel free to reach out to us and make a request, we will respond back to you atleast 48 business hours after making you r
            request.
